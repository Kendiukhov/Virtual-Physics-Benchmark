# Virtual-Physics-Benchmark
This repo sketches a benchmark harness where AI agents must rediscover hidden physical laws by running experiments inside virtual worlds. Each world is governed by a fully known but potentially "weird" law; we can score agents on how well their discovered formulas predict motion or match the ground truth.
